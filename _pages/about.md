Hi, I am Junxiang Wang. I am currently hold a research association position at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, working on multi-physics modelling of material fracture behavior. I obtained my doctorate degree from the University of Padova, Italy, majoring in computational mechanics.

I won a full scholarship from the University of Padua to start my Ph.D. study
from Oct. 2019 to Jun. 2023. My research topic is "Mathematical Modelling of
porous media (Soil) subjected to complex loading conditions", with special attention
paid to their cyclic and hydraulic fracture behavior, under the supervision of
Prof.  Valentina Salomoni and Prof. Giovanna Xotta. During my stay in Italy, I
also obtained an extra scholarship to visit the University of Stuttgart and conduct
research on the hydraulic fracture of sandstone, under the supervision of Prof. Wolfgang Ehlers. 
Prior to pursuing my PhD, I was awarded a grant to spend a semester as an exchange student in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, which strengthened my resolve to further my education abroad and gain international experience.

Overall, I enjoy working in the numerical modelling field, I am passionate about mathematics and utilizing it with modern programming skill (e.g. C++, Python),  to research and replicate physic law.  

Please reach out to me via Email with questions, suggestions, ideas or collaboration proposals.

Please refer to the CV section for details about my career path, experiences and extracurricular activities.
