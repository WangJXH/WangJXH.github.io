I am a Computer Science Doctoral Student at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, supervised by Prof. Dr Mo Li in the Wireless and Networked Distributed Sensing group.

My research focuses on resilient and efficient wireless communication, from ultra-low power communication, advanced spectrum sensing, interference detection and mitigation to intelligent jamming on the physical and message access control layer (LoRa, 4G/5G, UWB, ..). We aim to pair machine learning, signal processing, low-level RTL and analog design approaches with state-of-the-art software defined radio platforms to build robust and efficient wireless communication systems.

Please reach out to me via Email with questions, suggestions, ideas or collaboration proposals.

Please refer to the CV section for details about my career path, experiences and extracurricular activities.
