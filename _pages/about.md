Hi, I am Junxiang Wang. I obtained my doctorate degree from the University of Padova, Italy, majoring in computational mechanics.

I won a full scholarship from the University of Padua to start my Ph.D. study
from Oct. 2019 to Jun. 2023. My research topic is "Mathematical Modelling of
porous media (Soil) subjected to complex loading conditions", with special attention
paid to their cyclic and hydraulic fracture behavior, under the supervision of
Prof.  Valentina Salomoni and Prof. Giovanna Xotta. During my stay in Italy, I
also obtained an extra scholarship to visit the University of Stuttgart and conduct
research on the hydraulic fracture of sandstone, under the supervision of Prof. Wolfgang Ehlers. 

Throughout my doctoral training, a finite element code  was developed for modeling the cyclic and
fracture behavior of porous media.  I participated in two workshops regarding computational plasticity
and Writing Subroutines with Abaqus, which has greatly deepened my theoretical
knowledge background of mathematical modeling and programming skills. As a result, I am now proficient in programming using C++, Python, and Fortran.

By working in the two research
groups in two different countries, I acquired essential skills for a competent
young researcher as well as a teamwork player suitable for working in a global environment. I am always fascinated by the mathematics and physics behind the real world.   I am able to take the initiative and learn new
skills efficiently to complete my goal well.  I learned the
\lstinline{git}  to control my increasing \lstinline{UEL-UMAT} code, which 
boosts the achievement of my modeling task.   

Please reach out to me via Email with questions, suggestions, ideas or collaboration proposals.

Please refer to the CV section for details about my career path, experiences and extracurricular activities.
